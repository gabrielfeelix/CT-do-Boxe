src/hooks/useFinanceiro.ts(51,24): error TS2352: Conversion of type 'ParserError<"Unable to parse renamed field at `aluno:alunos(!inner(nome, email))`">[] | null' to type 'PagamentoCompleto[]' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
  Type 'ParserError<"Unable to parse renamed field at `aluno:alunos(!inner(nome, email))`">[]' is not comparable to type 'PagamentoCompleto[]'.
    Type '{ error: true; } & String' is missing the following properties from type 'PagamentoCompleto': status, aluno_id, valor, id, and 2 more.
